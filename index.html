                <ol>
                    <li>Build a scalable and efficient platform that supports at least 500 concurrent users, maintaining 90% uptime and an average system response time of 2 seconds or less, ensuring smooth performance as usage grows.</li>
                    <li>Develop a responsive and user-friendly Angular-based session booking interface that renders available tutors within 1 second of selection input and allows students to complete a booking in no more than 3 clicks.</li>
                    <li>Implement a secure authentication system with JWT-based authentication, ensuring that 99.9% of login requests are processed within 2 seconds, while protecting user data with encryption and role-based access control (RBAC).</li>
                    <li>Ensure all tutor-student matching requests process within 1.5 seconds under peak load (500 concurrent users). Conduct stress tests, targeting less than 2% error. </li>
